The French Revolution created a vision for a new moral universe: that sovereignty resides in nations; that a constitution and the rule of law govern politics; that people are equal and enjoy inalienable rights; and that church and state should be separate.<br>B. The French Revolution invented modern revolution &mdash;the idea that humans can transform the world according to a plan&mdash;and so has a central place in the study of the social sciences.<br>C. It ushered in modernity by destroying the foundations of the &ldquo;Old Regime&rdquo;&mdash;absolutist politics, legal inequality, a &ldquo;feudal&rdquo; economy (characterized by guilds, manorialism, and even serfdom), and an alliance of church and state.<br>D. That vision is enshrined in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789, whose proclamation of &ldquo;natural, imprescriptible, and inalienable&rdquo; rights served as the model for the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.

During the 24-hour darkness of the austral autumn and winter, the South Pole Telescope operates nonstop under impeccable conditions for astronomy.<br>B. The atmosphere is thin (the pole is more than 9,300 feet above sea level, 9,000 of which are ice), stable (due to the absence of the heating and cooling effects of a rising and setting Sun) and the pole has some of the calmest winds on Earth, blowing almost always from the same direction.<br>C. &ldquo;The South Pole has the harshest environment on Earth, but also the most benign,&rdquo; says William Holzapfel, a University of California at Berkeley astrophysicist, the on-site lead researcher at the South Pole Telescope.<br>D.

Nor will Chinese, Russian, or Indian culture soon shoulder aside the American version-high or low- whose draw is embodied by Harvard and Hollywood.<br>C. Once a standard exists, it tends to perpetuate itself-just like the dollar, for all its ups and downs will not soon yield to the Euro or the Renminbi.<br>D.

Nevertheless, the focus of otherwise very different movements - from cultural feminism to environmentalism to radical jihadism - is fundamentally the same: moral regulation.<br>B. Identity politics constantly demands the creation of new identities and lifestyle groups, often hostile to one another.<br>C. The main beneficiary of this shift from explicit political clashes to new forms of culture war has been identity politics.<br>D.

The bloody upheavals and wars occurred not in Europe, America or Russia, but in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and were either directly or indirectly a response to the experience of Western colonialism.<br>C.

With his iconic painting, Margritte showed how art can change our view of this world and give us a fresh opportunity to attempt to define the indefinable.<br>B. Magritte, who considered himself a thinker who communicated through paint, wanted to prove that images could equal words in the expression of consciousness.<br>C. In painting this, Margritte was inspired by the definition of a poem by popular literary figures Andr&eacute; Breton and Paul &Eacute;luard, who declared that &ldquo;Poetry is a pipe&rdquo;.<br>D. One of Ren&eacute; Magritte&rsquo;s most famous paintings, &ldquo;The Treachery of Images,&rdquo; features an image of a tobacco pipe with the words &ldquo;This is not a pipe&rdquo; underneath it.</span></li></ol><ol class="c1 lst-kix_kuoss2pju452-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c2">BDCA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.

Hopelessness, exhaustion and dwindling control over national economic life are the themes of politics all across the world.<br>B. As a result, states have been forced to shed social commitments in order to reinvent themselves as custodians of the market.<br>C. This has drastically diminished national political authority in both real and symbolic ways.<br>D. The destruction of state authority over capital has been the clear-cut objective of the financial revolution that defines our present era.</span></li></ol><ol class="c1 lst-kix_kuoss2pju452-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c2">ADCB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.

This is especially useful in the jungle, where dense vegetation rapidly degrades auditory information, though not seismic cues.<br>C. A two-tiered communication model based on hearing and feeling provides an effective way of sending messages to nearby herd members as well as more distant rival herds.<br>D.

After the dissolution of the Mongol empire, a group of Muslim Tatars, fleeing the Turko-Mongol ruler Tamerlane, asked the Christian grand duke of Lithuania for asylum.<br>D.

The reader&#39;s mind naturally seeks to complete the shapes, and in doing so, it slows down the reading process and improves memory.<br>B. Based on this idea, a new font, Sans Forgetica, has been created by psychology and design researchers at RMIT University in Melbourne.<br>C. Sans Forgetica is sleek and back-slanted with intermittent gaps in each letter, which serve as a simple puzzle for the reader.<br>D.

A drop in household consumption due to the rise in private debt was a key driver of the recession in the U.S.<br>B. Indeed, the lack of regulatory control over the growth in credit as well as the flow of credit into real estate was the issue.<br>C. A crucial aspect of the 2008 financial crisis was the build-up of debt in households and in non-financial firms.<br>D.

More recently, the concentration of a few dominant players in many industries, along with the decline of labor unions, has raised the issue of monopsony once again.<br>B. Monopsony power was a key feature of the company towns that helped define the Industrial Revolution, since everybody served one employer in most of these towns.<br>C. In the labor market context, this means that negotiating ability is tilted toward corporations, making it difficult for workers to push for higher pay.<br>D. Monopsony is a situation wherein there are many providers of a product in the market but only one dominant buyer, who holds all the cards and can drive prices down.</span></li></ol><ol class="c1 lst-kix_kuoss2pju452-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c2">BACD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.

Studies reveal that Martian brines today could hold higher concentrations of oxygen than were present on Earth about 2.4 billion years ago, when the first landmass emerged on Earth.<br>B. Although Mars is today a freeze-dried desert, it possesses abundant reserves of subsurface water ice, as well as some amount of liquid water in the form of brines.<br>C. These pools of salty liquid can capture even meager amounts of oxygen from the Mars&rsquo; atmosphere, creating a reservoir that microbes might metabolically utilize.<br>D. The brines&rsquo; high salt content lowers the temperature at which they freeze, allowing them to remain liquid even on the Red Planet&#39;s frigid surface.</span></li></ol><ol class="c1 lst-kix_kuoss2pju452-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c2">BDCA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.

In 17th-century Amsterdam, it was highly common for the guilds to commission portraits of themselves wearing their uniforms and holding weapons.<br>B. It was Rembrandt&rsquo;s riveting interplay of light, motion, texture and expression transformed a commonplace commission into a masterwork.<br>C. Its status and critical acclaim, though, have little to do with its subject matter: a civic-guard group tasked with keeping watch on the city walls.<br>D.

The metric system was created with the intention of liberating the common man and woman from the confusing and inconsistent weights and measures of the old regime.<br>D.
