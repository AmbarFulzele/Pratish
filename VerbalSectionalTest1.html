The first is to ignore people and simply hope they will act in your best interest. You probably will agree that this is not a very practical option, since the results can be neither effective nor predictable. By ignoring other people, you are giving up any hope of influencing them and thus are surrendering yourself to the whims of fate. In effect, you are saying to the world, &ldquo;I will leave you alone and, in return, I want you to do what I want&rdquo;, a naive and unrealistic expectation. The second option is to use coercion and force to compel others to act in the specific way desire. The use of threats and intimidation may produce results, at least in the short term. Fear-inducing tactics, however, never bring out the best in the people, since people </span><span class="c3">themselves </span><span class="c0">must be the driving force behind their motivation if they are to put their hearts and souls into what they are doing. Fear forces people to operate in a survival mode. They may follow your instructions and orders to the letter, but seldom will they contribute any real energy or enthusiasm to their efforts. The third option is to persuade people to do what you want them to do simply because </span><span class="c3">they really want to. </span><span class="c0">People will do what you want them to do willingly in direct proportion to how they see their self-interest being served. In other words, you must convince people that they will receive real benefits and rewards if they follow the path you are suggesting. These benefits must be something the other party understands and inherently wants, for whatever reason. In effect, you are offering a reward that is valued by others in exchange for a reward that is valued by you. The highest reward you can offer people is to provide them with opportunities to maximize their full potential. </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Q1.
