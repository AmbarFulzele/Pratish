D </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The decision to withdraw subsidy has clearly been taken to compensate for the loss and not because people can now </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">afford to pay more for cooking gas. So, I does not follow. Also, the statement talks of withdrawing 33% of the </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">prevailing subsidy and not of reducing 33% of the actual price. So, II also does not follow. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">Solutions (31-35) </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">31. A </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Clearly, harnessing solar energy will be helpful as it is an inexhaustible resource unlike other resources. So, argument </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I holds. But argument II is vague as solar energy is the cheapest form of energy. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">32. A </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Clearly, India cannot part with a state that is a major foreign exchange earner to it. So, argument I holds strong. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c3">Further, giving away a piece of land unconditionally and unreasonably is no solution to settle disputes. So, argument </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">II is vague. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">33. A </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Clearly, shifting agriculture is a practice in which a certain crop is grown on a land and when it becomes infertile it is </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c3">left bare and another piece of land is chosen. Clearly, it is a wasteful practice. So, only argument I holds. </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c45"><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c42"><span class="c2">34. A </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Clearly, India can export only the surplus and that which can be saved after fulfilling its own needs, to pay for its </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">imports. Encouragement to export cannot lead to shortages as it shall provide the resources for imports. So, only </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c3">argument I holds. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">35. B </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Clearly seriousness among the students is not because of fees but second argument is strong. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">Solutions (36-40) </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">36. D </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Clearly, with the ban on political parties, candidates can independently contest elections. So, it will not end </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">democracy. Thus, argument II does not hold. Argument I does not give a strong reason. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">37. B </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Argument I lacks substance and is hence weak. That it is a &ldquo;flying coffin&rdquo; is evident from the statement itself. II is </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">strong because it makes no sense to ban the aircraft when the responsibility lies somewhere else. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">38. B </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Argument I is weak because it says virtually nothing. II is strong because distraction from studies is not desirable. </span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c2">39. B </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Not all spurious drugs lead to mass murder. So we cannot assume I to be true. Hence I is weak. II is strong because </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">death sentence is self-defeating. If one dies, how can one be reformed? </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c28">40. D </span><span class="c40">Both I and II are weak arguments. I merely mentions the two occasions when the donation was banned. It does not </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">pinpoint the core issue.

It adds no argumentative </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">substance in support of &lsquo;No&rsquo;. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">Solutions (41-45) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">41. B </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The word &lsquo;just&rsquo; implies that it must be assumed that people wants ads at the lowest cost. Hence I is not necessarily </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">true. II is obvious; otherwise why will ads like this be given? </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">42. E </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">I is implicit because it make no sence to talk of something without the existence of its possibility. II is implicit; that is </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c3">why the speaker suggests tools to make change in the women&rsquo;s status. </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c45"><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c42"><span class="c2">43.

C </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Either assumption I or assumption II implicit the statement. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">45. B </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">I is not implicit. It is clearly criticism of Indian organizations not paying considerable attention to those aspects. So, II </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">is implicit. </span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c2">Solutions (46-50) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">46. E </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">As the people surprise the fact that the princes has married a commoner ,i.e, a person not of her status and &#39;not&#39; of </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">royal blood&#39; suggest that assumptions I and II are implicit. </span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c2">47. B </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Since nothing has been said about the earlier scheme or law so we cannot say about the efficiency of the new scheme. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Thus assumption I is not implicit. The highlight of the scheme is that people may retain their property by paying </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">lowest ever rate of tax. Thus it can be safely assumed that people desire to pay less tax and own things legally. Thus </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c3">assumption II is implicit. Hence the required answer is (2). </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">48. E </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">When a notice is issued it is expected that the people for which it is issued will pay attention to it. Also the theme of </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">the statement is desirable. Here the theme is reduction of tax, which can be constructed as reduction in expenditure. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c3">Hence, the required answer is 5. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">49.

Advocates insist that health savings accounts are an efficient method to reduce medical expenses. However, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">widespread adoption of these accounts will soon undermine the public&lsquo;s health. One reason for this is that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">most people will be reluctant to deplete their accounts to pay for regular preventive examinations, so that in </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">many cases a serious illness will go undetected until it is far advanced. Another reason is that poor people, who </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">will not be able to afford health savings accounts, will no longer receive vaccinations against infectious </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">diseases. The statements above, if true, most support which of the following? </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">a) Wealthy individuals will not be affected negatively by health savings accounts. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">b) Private health insurance will no longer be available. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">c) Most diseases are detected during regular preventive examinations. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">d) Some people without health savings accounts are likely to contract infectious diseases. </span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">14.

<h1>Assignment 2 Home Work</h1>
<p class="c4"><span class="c2">Directions (41-45): Below is given a passage followed by several possible inferences which can be drawn from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">the facts stated in the passage. You have to examine each inference separately in the context of the passage and </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">decide upon the degree of truth or falsity. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Please read the given paragraph and answer the questions that follows: </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">The authors, Caterina Alacevich and Alessandro Tarozzi, use data from India&rsquo;s National Family and Health Surveys </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">and the Health Survey of England to look at the heights of children and adults of Indian ethnicity living in England </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">and compare them with those of children and adults living in India. They find that ethnic-Indian adults were on </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">average 6-7 cm taller than those living in India, which could indicate a positive selection of migrants coming over to </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">England. But ethnic Indian adults in England are also less tall than British &ldquo;whites&rdquo;. Interestingly, when they look at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">young ethnic-Indian children in England who are between two and four years old, they notice that not only are they </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">taller than children in India, they are as tall as British &ldquo;white&rdquo; children. This leads them to conclude that the healthier </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">socio-economic environments in England have enabled Indian children to rapidly catch-up to the &ldquo;standards </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">observed&rdquo; for other children, giving fillip to the argument that &ldquo;nurture&rdquo; is more important to change in height of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">children than genetic factors. The authors point to some caveats in their study &mdash; they are unable to explain gaps in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">heights after puberty between ethnic Indians and whites in England and suggest that there is some degree of genetic </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">factors that could come to play in adolescence. </span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">41.

For example, let&#39;s say that the population of Greenland increased by 6 percent from </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">1000 to 1060 people, while the consumption of poultry increased by 9percent from 100 to 109 units. The per capita </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">consumption in 1999 would have been exactly 100/1000 while the per capita consumption in 2004 would have been </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">109/1060, a slightly greater value. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">12.

Neither does anything in the passage preclude a person who has an IQ of 130 </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">and is attending an VindyaMandir school to have graduated from TopNotch School. Therefore, it is possible for both </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">situations to exist simultaneously, so the conclusion is valid. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">13. D </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">The argument states that &quot;poor people, who will not be able to afford health savings accounts, will no longer receive </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">vaccinations&quot;. Based on this statement, it is reasonable to conclude that some people without health savings are likely </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">to contract infectious diseases. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">14. A </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">In general, Indira Gandhi experiences a greater number of delays per 100 flights than Shivaji does. However, when </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">delays caused by bad weather are discounted, Shivaji has 5 fewer delays per 100 flights. Since the two airports run </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">the same number of flights, bad weather must cause a greater number of delays at Indira Gandhi Airport than at </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shivaji Airport. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">15. C </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">This statement properly identifies the point that, for ordering from an out-of-state mill to be less expensive, the </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">shipping and handling fees must be less than the difference in the flour costs of the two suppliers. Say, for example, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">that a batch of flour costs $100 from Charles&lsquo;s Local Mill. The passage tells us that the same batch would cost $90 </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">from Isildiur&lsquo;s Mill, yet when purchasing from Isildiur&lsquo;s, shipping and handling fees would apply. We are told that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isildiur&lsquo;s total cost is cheaper than Charles&lsquo;s, so mathematically that is: $90 + Shipping &amp; Handling &lt; $100, which </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">means that Shipping &amp; Handling &lt; $10 = 10% of the cost of flour from Charles&lsquo;s. </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c2">Solutions (16-20) </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">16.

Further, the unemployed people thriving on tuitions can </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">survive with the school teachers holding tuitions too, if they are capable enough to guide the students well. So, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">argument II also does not hold strong. </span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c32 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c2">12. B </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Clearly, capability is an essential criteria for a profession and reservation cannot ensure capable workers. So, neither I </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">nor III holds strong. However, making one caste more privileged than the other through reservations would hinder the </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">objectives of a classless society. So, argument II holds strong. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">13. C </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Clearly, if the income of farmers is not adequate, they cannot be brought under the net of taxation as per rules </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">governing the Income Tax Act. So, I is not strong. Besides, a major part of the population is dependent on agriculture </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">and such a large section, if taxed even with certain concessions, would draw in huge funds, into the government </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">coffers. Also, many big landlords with substantially high incomes from agriculture are taking undue advantage of this </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">benefit. So, both arguments II and III hold strong. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">14.D </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The issue discussed in the statement is nowhere related to increase in unemployment, as the number of vacancies </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">filled in will remain the same. Also, in a working place, it is the performance of the individual that matters and that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">makes him more or less wanted, and not his educational qualifications. So, neither I nor II holds strong. Besides, the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">needs of a job are laid down in the desired qualifications for the job. So, recruitment of more qualified people cannot </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">augment productivity. Thus, IV also does not hold strong. However, it is the right of an individual to get the post for </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">which he fulfils the eligibility criteria, whatever be his extra merits. Hence, argument III holds strong. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">15. A </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">For I-True, because it can be assumed that meeting between PM Modi and Trump will empower the relation between </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">both nations as it is given that US is looking forward to strengthen ties with India. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">For II-True, because it can also be assumed from the given statement that the meeting of the leaders will provide </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">some common grounds to strengthen the ties between the two countries. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">For III-This statement is false because it states that no one is expecting some major steps from this meeting but it is </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">given that US is looking forward to strengthen the relation with India. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Solution(16-20): </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">16. C </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">For I- This is appropriate course of action as proper facilities and infrastructure will help the farmers. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">For II-This is also appropriate course of action because if farmers get appropriate price for their products then the </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">problem of waiving off loans can be resolved. </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c32 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c3">For III-III will be appropriate course of action because if the farmers have enough credit to meet their needs , loan </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">waiver problem may get solved. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">17. A </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The conclusion about better education at school A is made by comparing the grades. But grades in the two schools </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">are awarded separately. Hence the conclusion couldn&rsquo;t be valid unless it was assumed that the grading systems of the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">two schools were alike. Hence III is implicit. Now if better grading means better education, I is implicit. II is not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">because nothing is mentioned of extra &ndash; curricular activities. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">18. A </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">A quarter is the common denomination of the periods mentioned here. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">19.

A </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Clearly, the issue is not so big as to allot all powers of admissions to colleges, to the University only. So, II does not </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">follow. The problem can be solved by circulating the information of the ousted students to all the colleges so as to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">ensure that such students do not get admission elsewhere also. This might prove useful in rectifying such students. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">So, I follows while III does not. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">22. A </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Getting the information well in advance clearly suggests that adequate water be saved for the crisis by proper </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">management and moderate cuts in water supply. Cultivating alternate crops may not prove viable for the farmers. So, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">only I and II follow. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">23. D </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Clearly, the private sector banks have done so to attract more and more customers of public sector banks. Thus, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">public sector banks should either reduce the rate of interest to match with that of private sector banks or highlight </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">those features which make them stand apart from private sector banks. So, either II or III follows. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">24.

So, both I and III follow. II appears to be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">vague. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">25. D </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">The problem discussed here clearly hints at the need for quick rehabilitation of bonded labourers. So, only III follows. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">26. E </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Such problems can best be dealt with by first detecting the lackenings in the existing system and then taking adequate </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">steps to remove them. So, only I follows. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">27. D </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Clearly, chloroquine can still be used to get rid of the non-resistant varieties, and new medicines developed for the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">resistant varieties. The patients can then be treated accordingly by performing tests for the causal mosquito. So, only </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">II and III follow. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">28. E </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">The Corporation has planned to install its plant so as to achieve cost-effective production of mineral water. Had there </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">been a loss, it could also acquire water from private companies. So, II does not follow. Besides, the local private </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">companies can survive by cutting costs or by extending their sales network to other cities. Thus, I does not follow. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Lastly, the Corporation seeks to provide healthy drinking water to the residents. Water for general use would still be </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">delivered through taps. Hence, III also does not follow. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">29.

We do not know if Erin&rsquo;s parents dislike dogs (choice a) or if Erin dislikes birds (choice </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">b).There is no support for choice d. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">32. D </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">The first sentence makes this statement true. There is no support for choice a. The passage tells us that the spa </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">vacation is more expensive than the island beach resort vacation, but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the spa is </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">overpriced; therefore, choice b cannot be supported. And even though the paragraph says that the couple was relieved </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">to find a room on short notice, there is no information to support choice c, which says that it is usually necessary to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">book at the spa at least six months in advance. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">33. A </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Because Mr. Sanchez spends many hours during the weekend working in his vegetable garden, it is reasonable to </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">suggest that he enjoys this work. There is no information to suggest that he does not like classical music. Although </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Mrs. Sanchez likes to cook, there is nothing that indicates she cooks vegetables (choice c). Mrs. Sanchez likes to </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">read, but there is no information regarding the types of books she reads (choice d). </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">34. C </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Since the paragraph states that Marlee is the younger cousin, Sara must be older than Marlee.

A </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Options 4 and 5 are facts that have stated in the passage. Option 2 is a fallacy has the passage clearly states that that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">the purview of development in megacities is not limited to engineers and technology experts. Option 1 and 3 can be </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">both considered as inferences from the paragraph. But option 3 is more of an advisory statement that points out what </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">needs to be done. Option 1 on the other hand validly states the need for an inclusive approach towards the </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">development issues in megacities and supports the observations in the given paragraph </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">37.

Options 2, 3 and 4 are facts as stated in the passage. Option 5 is an </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">assumption as observed from the passage. Option 1 is the correct inference as it correctly tells about the need for </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">sustainable water management for the Kolkata Metropolitan Area future betterment. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">38. B </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">The given passage talks about how wetlands were considered unimportant till 1970s and the change in this </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">conception since then. Thus option 1 is a wrong assumption. Option 3 is a fact as stated in the passage. Options 4 and </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">5 are correct assumptions as they have not been directly mentioned in the passage. Option 2 is an inference as it can </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">be derived from the last sentence of the given passage. The last sentence clearly states that a certain group of </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">individuals are campaigning for the protection and conservation of the wetlands. Thus it can be inferred that </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">conservationists are working to create awareness regarding the importance of wetlands. Hence option 2 is the correct </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">inference. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">39. C </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">The passage talks about the New York City subway system and how it has contributed to the growth and betterment </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">of the city. Options 2 and 4 are fallacies as they don&rsquo;t tally with what has been stated in the passage. Option 1 is a fact </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">while option 5 although can be considered to be an inference does not present a clear picture. Option 3 on the other </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">hand is a better inference as it presents a clear picture and deducts correctly how even well planned old systems can </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">aid us in modern times. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">40. B </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Toxoplasma gondii can cause pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. So, it definitely cannot be considered to be benign. It </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">is also explicitly stated in the passage that Toxoplasma gondii is spread through the consumption of unwashed </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">vegetables. So this is a fact, not an inference. It is stated in the passage that toxoplasma gondii often goes incognito in </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">the body, but you cannot infer from this that it loves to play dress-up. It also cannot be inferred that toxoplasma </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">gondii is the chief cause of pre-eclampsia. It is just mentioned in the passage that it causes pre-eclampsia. So this </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">cannot be an inference either. However, it has been mentioned in the passage that the parasite rarely lets the host </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">know that it has set up residence in her body, which implies that it doesn&rsquo;t usually display any symptoms. Thus we </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">can infer that toxoplasma gondiii is usually asymptomatic. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Solution(41-50): </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">41.
